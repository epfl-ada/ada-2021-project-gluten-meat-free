Bigrams are couples of words that often co-occur in given contexts: e.g CT scan, Prime Minister, United States etc. We would like to find only those pairs of words that form a meaningful bigram. In order to do so, we first need to introduce the notion of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) score (write equation here). This measure indicates how much more likely the two words co-occur than if they were independent. However, this method is very sensitive to rare combinations of words: for example, if 'abc def' appear once together as a bigram, but 'abc' and 'def' individually are not present in the text, this will result in a high PMI score for the bigram 'abc def'. In order to overcome this limitation, we will combine this method with a frequency filter to retain only those bigrams that appear with a frequency higher than an arbitrary threshold decided by us.\n",
